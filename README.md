# Unbrokable by trustwise

Unbrokable project falls under the ~~*IoT*~~ *BoT* (Blockchain of Things) category.  
It is a fully blockchain managed solution that makes secure loans trustless.

## How it works

Two parties agree on the secure loan parameters (physical collateral, loan value, payback value, payback deadline).  
One party has the role of the loaner and the other of the lender.  
The smart contract template is filled and submitted to the blockchain by the lender.  
The loaner puts a physical item as a collateral in the vault and closes the vault.  
The lender verifies the loaner's action. (making sure that the valueable collateral item is actually in the box for example)  
The vault status is now in the fate of the blockchain.  
If the loaner pays back before the deadline then the loaner can finally unlock the vault and get the collateral back.  
If the loaner fails to pay before the deadline then, after the deadline, the lender can unlock the vault and aquire the collateral item.

The vault could be stand-alone or even provided by a bank/post-office
